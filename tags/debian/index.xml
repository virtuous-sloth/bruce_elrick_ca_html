      <description>Motivation A user of Ubuntu might want to validate the source code of an Ubuntu package by downloading it with pull-lp-source1 or apt-get source. This will tell them the bundle of source code from some upstream source that the packaged is based on as well as all the Debian- and Ubuntu-specific patches that have been applied. Coupled with upstream git repositories as well as Debian2 and Ubuntu3 ones.
All that information provides most of the context to answer questions like &amp;ldquo;does this version of this package have this patch?</description>
